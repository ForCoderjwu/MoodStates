### Overview
This is a Machines with 5 mood drawing, and 1 more introduction state

### How it works
I used 5 different mood drawing (PNG) and put them into the asset folder, then using the array for image and display by the key that the user imput with.  
Then I used the forloop and text to create an instruction screen, and update a initial screen for the first.
